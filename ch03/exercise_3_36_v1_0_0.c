 * Description: (How Fast Is Your Computer?) How can you determine how fast your own computer 
 *              operates? Write a program with a while loop that counts from 1 to 1,000,000,000, 
 *              incrementing by 1 during each iteration of the loop. Every time the count reaches a 
 *              multiple of 100,000,000, print that number on the screen. Use your watch to time how
 *              long each 100 million iterations of the loop takes. [Hint: Use the remainder 
 *              operator to recognize each time the counter reaches a multiple of 100,000,000.]
