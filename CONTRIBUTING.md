## ðŸ“‚ File Naming and Versioning

### Adding a Solution to a New Exercise

- If you are adding a solution to an exercise that is not already present in the repository, the file must be named in the following format:
  ```
  exercise_<chapter_number>_<exercise_number>_v1_0_0.c
  ```
  **Example:** For chapter 2, exercise 11, the file should be named:
  ```
  exercise_2_11_v1_0_0.c
  ```

### Updating an Existing Solution

- If you are submitting an updated solution to an existing exercise, use Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for naming:
  ```
  v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>
  ```

#### Versioning Rules

- **MAJOR Version**:
  - Increment when making backward-incompatible changes.
  - Example: Moving from v1.0.0 to v2.0.0 indicates significant changes that may break compatibility.
- **MINOR Version**:
  - Increment when adding new features or functionality that is backward-compatible.
  - Example: Moving from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0 means added features.
- **PATCH Version**:
  - Increment for small fixes or optimizations that do not change functionality.
  - Example: Moving from v1.2.3 to v1.2.4 means bug fixes or formatting corrections.

#### Example of Updated Solution

If the file `exercise_3_47_v1.0.0.c` is updated to add a new method to solve the problem:

```
exercise_3_47_v1.1.0.c
```

If a bug is fixed in the same solution:

```
exercise_3_47_v1.1.1.c
```

#### Note

For any case, always create a new file for the respective updated solution to an existing exercise, e.g.:

```plaintext
c_how_to_program_9ed_deitel_exercises/
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ ch03/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exercise_3_47_v1.1.1.c
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exercise_3_47_v1.1.1.c
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ ch04/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ...
```
